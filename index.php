              It is a story of a Rich man who had four sons. As rich man grew old he decided to give his property to his son
              who would value his wealth most. So, he called his sons and gave each of them five Grains of rice and told them
              that he would ask for these grains at the end of 5 years. At last he said that he will give all his property
              to the son who will value these grains most. First son threw away the grains and decided to show some other grains
              when father would ask from them. He thought that his father will not be able to guess difference between the set
              of grains. Second son ate them and like the first son thought of showing other grains when father demands. Third
              son kept grains in silver box at home and offers prayer to box while praying to God. Fourth son went to his home
              and sow those grains in his backyard. He cultivated them in backyard and after they grow harvested them.
              He kept on re sowing the grains from this crop and in 5 years time period he had a vast plot of land cultivated
              with rice. After 5 years when all the sons reached home. Father gave his property to fourth son as he was
              the one who valued those grains the most.

              How Resources, Skills and Abilities Makes a Difference. Japanese loved fresh fish but for decades close by
              water has not held many fishes. So to feed Japanese population, fishing boats got bigger and went further
              and further than before. Further the fisherman went for fishing, more time it took them to bring back the fish.
              Because it took a lot of time to get back after catching fishes, fishes were not fresh and didn’t taste good.
              Now, to solve this problem, Fisherman started to install freezers on their boats. So that after catching fishes
              they could freeze them at sea and this allowed fishermen to go further and stay longer to catch more fishes.
              However, Japanese could taste the difference and they didn’t like frozen fish. This made Fishing company think
              for further solution and installed fish tanks in their boats. Now, they would catch the fishes and stuff them
              in tanks. After little trashing around these fishes were tired, dull and lost their freshness. This lead
              fishing companies to face an impending crisis. Today, same fishing companies get fresh fish to Japan..!!
              Wonder how they managed to keep the freshness of fishes?? To keep fishes fresh. Japanese fishing companies
              still put the fishes in the fish tank but with a small shark..!! Because of shark fishes are challenged
              and constantly on move. This challenge keeps them alive and fresh.

              Love- A state beyond Perversions
              These days when you think of love, you are mostly thinking of a transaction between two or more identities.
              Let’s talk about a young couple…..
              In the process of being young they develop certain needs. These needs can be physical, mental or social. Now for their needs they require a conductor. So, they try to be in a relationship, which they call as love. In the start of this relationship things are very pleasant. The whole world appears to be beautiful. There is always an excitement to uncover the new dimensions of life. This is that stage when every act of the partner looks incredible. But as the time passes the elations are in trouble. On the other hand by the time this concern initiates, it’s possible that they might have formed a requirement of being together. So under the influence of attachments the relationship still goes on. They may tell that they still love each other. But in reality the process of ownership takes over the whole drama and combat becomes inevitable. Bit by bit the bond becomes venomous and either departure or brawl becomes the way to live.
              This has to be understood, this was anything but not love. This was simply a give and take idea. In the initial stages this idea was over ruled by the excitement of discoveries. But as the time progressed reality became quite evident. The moment you want to put a restriction, it is not love. The whole thing will turn stagnant and starts stinking.
              Then what is love?
              Love is an open-ended actuality which is far beyond the numerous perversions of our thoughts.
              It’s possible that love may find some expressions but in reality it is an unexplained existence which cannot be framed in words. Try to understand that when you are in love with something or somebody, it’s only you who is available to witness this purity and bliss. Love is a state in which you experience divinity. Love is something which adds expansion to your existence and experience. The more you love the more union you make with this universe. The state of love may come to you by different means. It may be initiated by looking at your friend or your parents or even your pets……it may happen anytime with anything. The point to be witnessed is -when it happens, no matter who is the initiator, you are under the shower of bliss.
              Problem is the habit of being in the state of love only when you have an initiator. If by any means you learn to be in this blissful state at your own. Life will become an endless celebration.
